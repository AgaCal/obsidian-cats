# Cat Reminders

Just a silly little Obsidian plugin to display cat pictures from the CatAPI to bring a little bit of joy into your vault.

## Usage

When enabled, you can use the ribbon element or ```get cat``` command to display a picture of a cat 

You can modify how long the cat shows up, and how often they will pop up on their own in the Cats setting tab.
